We have three tiers of tutor and believe in being straightforward and transparent with payments:

- Tier One: These tutors are new to the profession with one or two years of experience and would cost £35 per hour. These tutors would be suitable for a KS3 student.

- Tier Two: These tutors have at least three years of experience and would cost £40 and would cost £40 per hour. These tutors would be suitable for a GCSE student.

- Tier Three: These are our most experienced tutors and hold or have held senior posts within an English department. These tutors would cost £45 per hour and would be suitable for a GCSE student or an A Level student.
