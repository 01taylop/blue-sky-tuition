Our key values fall under two components: Honesty and Belief.

Honesty. In a largely unregulated market, there are a lot of companies who will happily employ somebody with little to no experience. HB Tuition guarantees that all its tutors are fully qualified English specialist teachers with a deep passion for English and education. Choose us and you get the best.

Belief. Contrary to common belief, we believe that the gap between students who excel at English and those that struggle is not that large. What separates them, in most cases, is Belief. Through our Personalised Learning Programmes and detailed discussions with all our tutees, we are certain that we can give them the belief to reach their aims.
