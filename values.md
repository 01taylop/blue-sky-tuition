Private tuition is an excellent way to increase confidence in any given subject area, as well as improving grades. Working on a one-to-one basis with a specialist teacher provides the student with the time and security to unpick and address key barriers to their learning leading to greater confidence, resilience and ultimately academic success.

The bespoke service provided through the personalise learning plans enables each student to make progress in relation to carefully identified learning objectives. However, we recognise that if tuition is to have maximum impact for the student it should not be seen as totally separate from their learning in school.

Therefore, we are committed to creating a network of support for each student. So, after each session there is a short consultation between tutor, parent and student to discuss progress and next steps in learning. Where possible, contact is also made with the student's school to help them to support the student to apply the learning gains in tuition within the context of the classroom.

Our aim is to ensure that by the end of a period of tuition, our students leave us as perceptive readers, fluent writers, confident communicators with a love of English and an appreciation of the power that language holds.
