Having worked in a variety of different schools and for several tuition companies, we believe we offer the best service for the five following reasons:

1. We are run by English teachers.

    Blue Sky Tuition only employs fully qualified English teachers to ensure you get the best value for your money.

2. All of our tutors are currently working in schools.

    We only employ tutors who are currently teaching English, believing that an active teacher can offer the best service for a vital subject.

3. Are costs are up front.

    You can find our tutor costs on the payment page. We also only ask you to pay for the amount of sessions you want.

4. English is our specialism.

    English is the only subject we tutor as it also allows us to share good practise, resources and knowledge. So if you hire a tutor from us, you know you'll hiring a tutor with a passion and understanding of English.

5. Personalised Learning Programmes

    We offer a free consultation where the tutee sits a short assessment before having detailed discussions with the tutee and parents about our aims. We will then devise a personalised plan which suits the tutees needs and aspirations.
