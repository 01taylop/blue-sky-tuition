Having worked in a variety of different schools and for several tuition companies, we believe we offer the best service for the five following reasons:

1. We are run by English teachers.

    As a largely unregulated market, there are several tuition agencies who employ tutors who have minimal to no teaching experience.  HB Tuition only employs fully qualified English teachers to ensure you get the best value for your money.

2. All of our tutors are currently working in schools.

    It feels that there isn't a year that passes where there isn't a change to the National Curriculum, so it can be easy to lose touch on the subtle changes across the exam boards and various courses. Therefore, we only employ tutors who are currently teaching English, believing that an active teacher can offer the best service for a vital subject. 

3. We charge you the same amount and pay our tutors the same amount.

    As all our tutors are fully qualified English teachers, we pay them the same rate of pay. We also charge you the same amount regardless of age or ability. This means you will be offered the most suitable tutor possible without money swaying any judgements whatsoever.

4. English is our specialism.

    If you need help with multiplication, we're afraid you're in the wrong place. English is the only subject we offer. Why? Because its what we specialise in and enjoy. It also allows us to share good practise, resources and expertise over all the exam boards. So if you hire a tutor from us, you know you'll hiring a tutor with a passion and understanding of English.

5. Personalised Learning Programmes

    We believe that students learn best when they understand the direction their learning is going. We offer a free consultation where the tutee sits a short assessment before having detailed discussions with the tutee and parents about our aims. We will then devise a personalised plan which suits the tutees needs and aspirations.
