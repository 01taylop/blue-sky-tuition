Working in a variety of different schools and for several tuition companies, we believe we offer the best service for the five following reasons:

1. **We only employ fully qualified English teachers.**

    Blue Sky Tuition only employs fully qualified English teachers to ensure your child receives the best quality tuition.

2. **All of our tutors are currently working in schools.**

    We only employ tutors who are currently teaching English, believing that an active teacher can offer the best service for a vital subject.

3. **All costs are up front.**

    You can find more information about our tutor costs on the payment page. We also only ask you to pay for the number of sessions you want.

4. **English is our specialism.**

    English is the only subject we tutor as it allows us to share good practise, resources and knowledge. So if you hire a tutor from us, you know you'll be working with a tutor who has a passion for and understanding of English.

5. **Personalised Learning Programmes**

    We offer a free initial consultation in which the tutee sits a short assessment followed by a discussion with the tutee and parents about the individual needs of your child. We will then devise a personalised tuition programme accross an agreed number of sessions.
